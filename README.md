# auto-apply
### A tool to help mass apply for jobs.

This tool is heavily reliant on my fork of [Deedy Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume).

### Use It:
1. Create a csv file job-data.csv and fill it in the same manner as can be seen in job-data.example.csv
2. run `EXPORT CVLOCAL=/path/to/location/` on Mac and Linux
2. Run `python apply.py` to produce a cover letter
3. Run `python resume.py` to produce a matching resume
